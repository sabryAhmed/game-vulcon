        <p className='text-center'>These exquisite mechanical marvels run the VulcanVerse on behalf of the God. Around and about the City wandering groups of Keledones, golden automaton maidens, sing and dance for the entertainment of gods and mortals. They’re otherworldly voices fill the air with a strange enchantment.</p>

Players can build upon their land, recruiting creatures (Vulcanites) developing their land, and as the Vulcanverse itself is developed, eventually adding buildings that give new functionality, produce goods, trade with other players and with Vulcan City, create their own games, quests, palaces, objects, art and more. Each plot of land is unique to the purchaser.</p>
        <p className='text-center'>There can only ever be one of each plot using blockchain technology. You can farm, upgrade and build upon your land as you see fit, buy others land and sell yours too. It will be the ultimate virtual world directly owned by you.</p>
